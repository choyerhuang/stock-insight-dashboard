"""
main.py - Backend for Stock Insight Dashboard

This Flask server handles HTTP requests and provides stock-related data
using Finnhub and Polygon.io APIs. It supports company details, price
quotes, historical charts, and recent news through a cloud-deployed 
RESTful architecture.

⚠️ Due to academic integrity policies, most of the code has been hidden. 
Please contact me directly if you're interested in the implementation 
(excluding currently enrolled students).
